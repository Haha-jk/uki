## Introduction
Utkrisht (uki) is a programming language for building frontend of web applications.

Utkrisht code is compiled into plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that runs directly in the browser.

## Language Features

- **Minimalistic syntax**: No boilerplate code while maintaining a readable structure.
- **Procedural**: Code runs top to bottom, with clear flow and structure.
- **Dynamically (but strongly) typed**: Values have types that are checked, but you don’t need to declare them explicitly.
- **Component-based UI**: Functions can return DOM elements, enabling modular UI building.
- **Readable compiled code**: Output is annotated with comments, so it’s understandable and debuggable.
- **Small bundle size**: No extra code is included—only what you write and what’s needed for the browser.
